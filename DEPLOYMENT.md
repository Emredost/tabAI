# TabAI Deployment Strategies

This document outlines various strategies for deploying TabAI to end users.

## 1. GitHub Releases (Recommended)

The easiest way to distribute TabAI is through GitHub Releases, which has been set up with the included GitHub Actions workflow.

### Process:

1. Push changes to your GitHub repository
2. Create a new tag when ready for release:
   ```
   git tag -a v1.0.0 -m "Version 1.0.0"
   git push origin v1.0.0
   ```
3. GitHub Actions will automatically build the application for all platforms and create a release
4. Users can download the appropriate installer from the Releases page

### Benefits:
- Automated builds for all platforms
- Version tracking
- Release notes
- Easy updates for users

## 2. Direct Distribution

If you prefer to distribute TabAI independently of GitHub, you can build the app locally and distribute the installers.

### Process:

1. Build for your desired platforms:
   ```
   npm run build:win    # For Windows
   npm run build:mac    # For macOS
   npm run build:linux  # For Linux
   ```
2. Distribute the installers from the `dist` directory via your preferred method:
   - Your own website
   - File sharing services
   - Direct download links

### Benefits:
- Complete control over distribution
- No dependency on GitHub
- Can be used with your own update system

## 3. Setting Up Auto-Updates

For a better user experience, consider implementing auto-updates in TabAI.

### Using electron-updater:

1. Install electron-updater:
   ```
   npm install electron-updater
   ```

2. Modify `main.js` to include update functionality:
   ```javascript
   const { autoUpdater } = require('electron-updater');
   
   // Check for updates
   app.on('ready', function() {
     autoUpdater.checkForUpdatesAndNotify();
   });
   
   // Listen for update events
   autoUpdater.on('update-available', () => {
     // Notify user
   });
   
   autoUpdater.on('update-downloaded', () => {
     // Prompt user to install
   });
   ```

3. Configure `package.json` with update settings:
   ```json
   "build": {
     "publish": [
       {
         "provider": "github",
         "owner": "yourusername",
         "repo": "tabai"
       }
     ]
   }
   ```

### Benefits:
- Seamless updates for users
- Ensures users have the latest version
- Improves security by keeping software updated

## 4. Creating an Installation Website

Create a dedicated website for TabAI using GitHub Pages or your own domain.

### Process:

1. Utilize the `docs` directory that has been created
2. Add download buttons linking to the latest releases
3. Include installation instructions for all platforms
4. Add screenshots and features list

### Benefits:
- Professional appearance
- Easier discovery for potential users
- Can include additional documentation and support information

## 5. Desktop App Stores (Optional)

Consider publishing TabAI to desktop app stores for wider distribution.

### Options:

1. **Microsoft Store**:
   - Register as a developer
   - Package the app using MSIX
   - Submit for approval

2. **Mac App Store**:
   - Enroll in Apple Developer Program
   - Prepare app for submission
   - Submit for review

3. **Linux Repositories**:
   - Create packages for different distributions (DEB, RPM)
   - Submit to repositories like Flathub, Snapcraft

### Benefits:
- Wider reach
- Trusted distribution channels
- Built-in update mechanisms

## Conclusion

The recommended approach is to use GitHub Releases with the automated workflow, combined with a simple website for discovery. This provides the best balance of ease of deployment and user experience.

As TabAI grows, you may want to implement auto-updates and consider additional distribution channels to reach more users.
