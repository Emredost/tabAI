## Troubleshooting

### AI Service Not Loading

Some AI services have security measures that prevent embedding in desktop applications. TabAI attempts to bypass these restrictions, but if an AI service fails to load:

1. Try refreshing the page using the refresh button.
2. Check your internet connection.
3. Ensure you're logged in to the service (if required).
4. If all else fails, the service will open in your default web browser instead.

### Performance Issues

If TabAI is running slowly:

1. Try closing unused tabs to free up resources.
2. Restart the application.
3. Ensure your computer meets the minimum system requirements.
